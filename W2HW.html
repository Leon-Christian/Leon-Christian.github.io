	<h2>  Ways of Seeing Thoughts  </h2>
		<body>
	The ways of seeing video series is such an interesting dissection of media and how we interact with media in our current society. From the ideas of what constitutes a reproduction to what it even means to be an "original" Berger makes the viewer think about their place in the production and consumption of media. One of the stand out moments for me was in the Third episode when Berger was talking about glamour. Particularly when we said "...Envy occurs in a society that has moved towards democracy but has stopped halfway" and then goes on to say "...Glamour can not exist without envy." In our current post capitalist, social media world. Everything has been commodified and consequently "Glamourized" nothing can escape the far reaching effects of envy and it will be interesting to see what effect this will have on society and culture going forward. Who will be 'allowed' to make culture? What will subcultures and countercultures look like? And what effect will this have on the burgeoning activist and social justice movements.

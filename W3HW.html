	<title>Week 3 Homework: As we May Think and Long Live The Web Response</title>
	</head>
	<h2>  Thoughts  </h2>
		<body>
	This week's readings talked about the then future, but now present, state of technology. The reading <i>"As We May Think"</i> by VANNEVAR BUSH was published in 1945. In this piece Bush talks about how the "future" of technology will allow information to be abundant and readily accessible to whomever is so inclined to seek it. He also briefly touches on what this may do to society and how he thinks this will positively benefit humanity. However he does end on a subtly chilling note teasing at the idea of artificial intelligence and and meshing of 
	humanity and machine.

	Interestingly in the second reading of the week <i>Long Live the Web</i> by Tim Berners-Lee the ideas of humanity's relationship to the internet is discussed. Berners-Lee warns against the internet being corrupted and misused by governments and corporations. This is an interesting discussion especially considering our current climate and relationship to social media, data mining, and the internet in general

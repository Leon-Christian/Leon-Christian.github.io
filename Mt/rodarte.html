    <h2>THE BACKGROUND</h2>
    <ul>
  		Tulle dresses and separates, manipulated and embellished in every possible way: studded with pearls, caviar beads, ostrich feathers, polka dots. Leather motocross jackets, cut cropped but full, pierced with yet more pearls. Delicate floral print chiffon dresses and jumpsuits. A fluttery cape and jumpsuit covered in massive 3D sequin blooms. A palette that ranged from the palest, purest pastels (sky blue, carnation pink, butter yellow) to vivid magenta, scarlet, and lemon. Sweet yet menacing . . . as one might expect from a Rodarte offering (said Laura Mulleavy, <i>This is the most Rodarte show we have ever made</i>). For every delicate gesture, every fluttering camisole, and skirt of asymmetric tiered ruffles there was a gutsy countermove: snakeskin and leather high shaft boots, stacks of gold arm cuffs in the shape of flowers or hearts, and shoulder dusting earrings.
<br>
  		But mostly there was babys breath, yes, real babys breath, which traditionally plays the role of the crowd when red roses star in prom corsages and bodega bouquets. Models hair was covered in it, as were a few of the loveliest dresses, and many of the girls walked the runways dragging massive bouquets of the white fluff behind them. <b>This was perhaps the most Rodarte gesture of the day: to remember and elevate the beauty of something so common, so prevalent, and so deeply associated with the romantic imagination of young women.</b>

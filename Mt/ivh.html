    <h2>THE BACKGROUND</h2>
    <ul>
  		By this point in her career, and with sufficient time for R&D, Iris Van Herpen can evoke just about any pattern in nature: plant membranes, feathers, fossils, fins, bubbles, sound waves, the current list is long and impressive. For this collection, along with exploring the branching forms of dendrites and deep-sea hydrozoa organisms, she seemed to be evoking their natural and varied states of movement. The first model to emerge out of darkness wore a gown featuring an intricate laser cut black leather corset. But what caught the eye was when she began gently waving her arms so that the pleated sleeves became billowing extensions of a root structure. Further on, sound waves painted and printed onto organza spheres were layered as a tiered dimensional shape that oscillated as though underwater.

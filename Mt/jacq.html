    <h2>THE BACKGROUND</h2>
    <ul>
  		During a preshow interview, Porte Jacquemus said he wanted his collection to talk of love and celebration, <i>like a simple country wedding or a harvest festival.</i> With everyone cocooning at home, he wanted to create something  <i>bubble like</i> to represent the moment.

		Ultimately, he named the collection L Amour, a declaration of love for his team, and sprinkled it with Provencal references, such as ceramics, a poem by Miro, a corner of a grandmothers tablecloth, and a colander of cherries. The show may have taken place in the great outdoors, but the clothes nodded to what we have all been experiencing inside.

		Where Porte Jacquemus really connected was on dresses that channel the typical Southern French insouciance: One and done numbers included a polo dress, and a slinky black number with contrasting stitching, breezy wheat sheaf beading, and tassels. A few white dresses, one in broderie anglaise, will probably do well by bucolic minded fans, bridal or otherwise. For men, a leaf print was as beguiling as leather knife and fork tassels were improbable; elsewhere, the Picasso motifs and cut out hearts might hit home with some fans. A sun washed color palette of sage, ecru, black, and clay looked universally flattering. Witty earrings coils, a Chiquito handbag, a bar of Marseille soap added to the fun, as did leather accessories like a harness for a single plate, or the new Chiquito Noeud, a variation on the house best seller.

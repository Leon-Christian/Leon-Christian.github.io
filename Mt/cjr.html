    <h2>THE BACKGROUND</h2>
    <ul>
  		Spanning a full 40 looks, Rogers first post-CFDA show brought back some familiar silhouettesâ€”there was the bulbous strawberry-shaped waist (Rogers says it has become one of his best sellers), which reappeared on the runway in violet, and he worked in some past references, like Pierrots, the French cinematic clowns that informed last seasons ruffled necklines. As for new inspirations, he cited trash bags, of all things, he says that a curtain brushing the floor in a Renaissance painting has the same energy as a crumpled garbage bag, and mid century couturier Alix Barton, also known as Madame Gres, whose later work skewed more graphic and progressive than the goddess-draped gowns that made her famous.

    <h2>THE RUN DOWN</h2>
    <ul>
  		This collection aimed to bring light to the unfrequented story of the black cowboys from the 19th century. The Western theme was exemplified with leather patchwork jackets, contrast topstitching and amplified wide-legged trousers. With musical direction guided by Raphael Saadiq, the story was tied together by choir sung renditions of Gil Scott-Herons <i>Home is Where the Hatred Is</i>, Bruce Springsteens <i>Born in the USA</i> and <i>Alright</i>, by Kendrick Lamar. This season marked the commencement of the Reebok by Pyer Moss partnership. A Mens and Womens Ready-To-Wear apparel collection, accompanied by unisex accessories and footwear, closed the show.

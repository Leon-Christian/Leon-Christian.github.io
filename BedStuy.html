<h1>Bed-Stuy: An Observation</h1>

<p>Bedford-Stuyvesant is a neighborhood in central Brooklyn encompassing the zip codes 11205, 11206, 11216, 11221, 11233 and 11238. The neighborhood started out as a rural farming community settled on Canarsie Native American Land by Dutch settlers. However, in the 1870’s the settlers began developing the farming hamlet into a more urban area when they began building the brick row houses the neighborhood is so well known for today.
<br>
<br>
Then in the late 1930’s, during the great depression, many Black southerners moved into the community. This led to many of the white residents moving further out of the area.
<br>
<br>
By 1950 55% of the population was Black. However the community received absolutely no government support and by the mid 60’s was woefully underserved.
<br>
<br>
In 1967, then New York Senator, Robert F Kennedy partnered with community organizers to launch the  Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation that revilized the area. 
<br>
<br>
Ever since then Bed-Stuy has been a bastion of Black culture and life. Producing some of the most well known Black art of the modern time.
<br>
<br>
However, The area is changing. Much of Bed-Stuy has already been impacted by gentrification: infrastructurally the area is now benefiting from expanded public transportation options, major sewer and water modernization projects, a new business district, and fiber-optic and cable upgrades. But culturally there have been many changes to the community. One of the most glaring is the rise in homlessness due to the dramatic increase in rent prices. Since 1990 rents in Bed-Stuy have increased over 36%. According to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2010, 30.7% of residents in Bed-Stuy were in poverty meaning that they could barely afford to pay their rent. There is a clear correlation between the rise in rent, income, and homelessness in the neighborhood. In addition, the people moving into the neighborhood are changing as well. According to a 2017 report released by state Controller Thomas DiNapoli “Many of the new residents are immigrants, white, or young, and are likely to have higher incomes than long-term residents, states the report. “Their arrival has put pressure on housing costs, making it increasingly less affordable for long-term residents, especially seniors, to remain in the neighborhood.” This shift in demographic has also led to various changes in the culture and relationships within Bed-Stuy. I hope through this photo story to highlight some of these tensions.</p>

<p>On the corner of Nostrand avenue and Lafayette avenue there are two ironically similar yet wildly different stores. One is a specialty coffee shop and the other is a typical corner Deli. I went into the Deli to get a cup of coffee and one of the first things I noticed was that the cashier seemed incredibly young. I didn't ask why but I assumed it was because the owners of the Deli were related to him and this was probably just a part of his weekend chores. An experience that is very common for the children of business owning immigrants like myself.
	<br>
	<br>
While I don't know the specific history of this Deli on the corner of Nostrand and Lafayette Deli’s are often owned and operated by a family and passed down throughout the generations becoming embedded in the communities that they serve. Conversely, after stalking the Coffee shops Instagram I found out that they opened only 4 years ago in 2016 and have been fairly popular with younger patrons. In addition, the coffee shop only sells coffee and limited selection of pastries. Which, to me, does not seem like a good business move when the Deli next door sells the same items and many more things as well.</p>

<p>This first diptych explores the relationship between imports and natives. On one side you have an image of a postmate on his way to deliver food to someone and in the other you have an image of a flyer advertising various locally owned and operated community gardens. I created this association because I believe it represents the perceived benefits of gentrification to communities. Efficiency, convenience, and variety are represented by the Postmate. However, community owned farmers markets may also be hurt by the same thing. </p>

<img src= "BedStuyProject/dyp2.jpg" alt="Row House & New Construction Dyptich" width="100%">
<p>The second diptych hints abstractly at the socio-aesthetic effects gentrification has on communities by placing an image of a row of traditional Bed-Stuy brownstones next to the doorway of a luxury, apartment building that is currently being developed. While the row houses are a variety of colours and made out of enduring masonry the new luxury development is clad in cheap white tiles that look sleek now but soon will chip and get dirty. To me this is one of the most detrimental issues with gentrification. None of the new developments are created to last, but rather they are created to look nice for a few years and then they fall apart. Many of the streets in Bed-Stuy still have the original homes built on them in the 1800’s still standing today.

<p> This section asks the question “What is development?” These three posters were placed on the green plywood surrounding a construction site. On one hand you have a poster advertising the artist Bizzy Banks, a drill rapper (a genre that originated in East New York) next to the image of the projected completed luxury mixed use building, and then next to that you have a protest poster calling to end over policing and systemic racism. These three posters are their own triptych that represent the past, present and future of Bed-Stuy. The poster of Banks represents the culture of the people that have called Bed-Stuy home, the past. The model of the Mixed use building represents the future of the area. And the protest posters represent the present. While we don't know who put up the protest poster it is interesting to see it in a community that's gentrifying. Was the person that placed the poster aware of the irony in the message, or were they trying to explicitly point that irony out.</p>

<p> My final image was taken outside the home of one of my family friends. Her family has lived in the area for two generations and her mother was a part of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority. A well known Black greek organization that focuses on community development. I choose to take this photo because it says so many things about Black culture, historically, and currently. Our necessity to change the issues with the current government while also supporting and uplifting the voices within out own communities.

When I interviewed my aunt one of the very first questions I asked her was “How has the area changed?” Her response was surprising. One of the first things she said is that there are a lot less police cars in the area than were there when she moved in almost 40 years ago. In addition, she says she is seeing the area change. The salon where she used to get her hair done closed down last year and one of her friends' restaurants had to close this summer. While she doesn’t like the gentrification she does see why its happening “Bed-Stuy is a beautiful place, when i moved here it seemed like a hidden gem. You walk down almost any street and you’re in love with the place all over again.” she goes on to say “...It definitely had its issues but it felt like they were issues with my family. Now I don't know, but I hope it will work itself out. Bed-Stuy won't give up that easy” she punctanted the statement with a chuckle and then went into the kitchen to get something to drink.</p>
